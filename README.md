### README

Breathe. Make no attempt to control your breath. Focus on its natural movement. Pause and pay attention. Notice different aspects of your experience. Observe youself without identifing as yourself. See how stable you actually are. Put your shoulders back.

There is no real purpose. The only things that matter are the ones you decide to make matter. Pursue incremental, evolutionary change. Stay on course. Remember what matters to you. What are you practicing? How are you behaving? 

Consistency of effort is key. The older you get the easier it is to predict the end result of an activity, so avoid doing things that won't produce long term fulfillment. Mastery requires patience: you'll need to keep your focus on five or ten years down the road. You can push past your limits but it will put you in risk of a breakdown. Be careful. Respect the process. This is a game of endurance and sustainability.

Wake up early. Read and write. Work intensely every day. Anticipate distractions, keep it simple and do one thing at a time. Avoid sugar and alcohol. Avoid hard drugs. Don't smoke too much. Don't waste money.

Drink water. Take your meds. Play with your kids.

Sleep. You are not in immediate danger.
